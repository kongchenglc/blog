Major Characteristics of a Project: Has an established objective. Has a defined lifespan with a beginning and an end. Involves several departments and professionals. Involves doing something never done before. Has specific time, cost, and performancerequirements. Program versus ProjectProgram Defined: A group of related projects designed to accomplish acommon goal over an extended period of time. Program Management Defined: A process of managing a group of ongoing, interdependent, related projects in a coordinated way to achieve strategic objectives. Examples: Project: completion of a required course in projectmanagement. Program: completion of all courses required for a businessmajor. StrategyTwo main reasons project managers need to understand their organization’s mission and strategy: So they can make appropriate decisions and adjustments. How a project manager would respond to a suggestion to modify the design of a product or to delays may vary depending upon strategic concerns So they can be effective project advocates. They have to be able to: Demonstrate to senior management how their project contributes to the firm’s mission in order to garner the continued support of management. Explain to stakeholders why certain project objectives and priorities are critical in order to secure buy-in. Explain why the project is important to motivate and empower the project team Organization and ScopeThree different project management structures are: Functional organization Dedicated project teams Matrix structure Weak matrix Balanced matrix Strong matrix Matrix StructuresWeak matrix This form is very similar to a functional approach with the exception that there is a formally designed project manager responsible for coordinating project activities. Functional managers are responsible for managing their segment of the project. The project manager acts as a staff assistant who draws the schedules and checklists, collects information on the status of the work, and facilitates project completion. Balanced matrix The project manager is responsible for defining what needs to be accomplished. The project manager establishes the overall plan for completing the project, integrates the contribution of the different disciplines, set schedules, and monitors progress. The functional managers are concerned with how it will be accomplished. The functional managers are responsible for assigning personnel and executing their segment of the project according to the standards and schedules set by the project manager. Strong matrix The project manager controls most aspects of the project, including scope trade-offs and assignment of functional personnel. The project manager controls when and what specialists do and has final say on major project decisions. The functional managers have title over their people and are consulted on a need basis. The functional managers serve as subcontractors for the project. Project Management Offices(PMOs) Is a centralized unit within an organization or a department that oversees and supports the execution of projects. Plays a critical role in helping matrix systems mature into more effective project delivery platforms. Can be characterized in different kinds: Weather station—tracks and monitors project performance. Control tower—improves project execution. Resource pool—provides the organization with a cadre of trained project managers and professionals. Command and control center—has direct authority over the project. Organizational Culture Is a system of shared norms, beliefs, values, and assumptions that blinds people together, thereby creating shared meanings. Reflects the “personality” of the organization. Performs several important functions in organizations. Provides a sense of identity for its members Helps legitimize the management system Clarifies and reinforces standards of behavior Helps create social order","link":"/blog/2024/10/24/About-Project-Management-Part-1/"},{"title":"About Project Management ( Part 2 )","text":"Cost and Time EstimationIs a trade-off, balancing the benefits of better accuracy against the costs of secured increased accuracy. Types of EstimatesTop-down (macro) estimates Analogy Group consensus Mathematical relationships Bottom-up (micro) estimates based on estimates of elements found in the work breakdown structure Why Estimating Time and Cost Is Important To support good decisions. To schedule work. To determine how long the project should take and its cost. To determine whether the project is worth doing. To develop cash flow needs. To determine how well the project is progressing. different aspects of estimating Range Accuracy Precision Confidence Factors Influencing the Quality of Estimates Planning Horizon: cost estimates for a party you are organizing this weekend should be much more accurate than the estimates for a party that will take place in six months. Project Complexity People: How familiar are they with the task they are estimating? Project Structure and Organization: In a matrix environment may take longer, since attention is divided and coordination demands. Padding Estimates: Most of us are inclined to add a little padding to reduce the risk of being late Organizational Culture Others: Equipment downtime, National holidays, vacations, etc. Estimating Guidelines for Times, Costs, and Resources Responsibility: estimates should be made by the person(s) most familiar with the task. The use of several people to estimate: leads to consensus and eliminate extreme estimate errors Normal conditions: based on certain assumptions. Estimates should be based on normal conditions, efficient methods, and a normal level of resources Time units: All task time estimates need consistent time units. Eg: calendar days, workdays, workweeks, person days, single shift, hours, minutes, etc. Independence: treat each task as independent of other tasks. To avoid some rough “guesstimate” of the total time for the whole path Contingencies: Work package estimates should not include allowances for contingencies. Risk assessment: to avoid surprises to stakeholders. Simply identifying the degree of risk Top-Down versus Bottom-Up EstimatingTop-Down Estimates Are usually derived from someone who uses experience and/or information to determine the project duration and total cost. Are sometimes made by top managers who have very little knowledge of the component activities used to complete the project. Bottom-Up Estimates Can take place after the project has been defined in detail. Can serve as a check on cost elements in the WBS by rolling up the work packages and associated cost accounts to major deliverables. Provide the customer with an opportunity to see various trade-offs in different project scenarios, such as time, cost, resources, and technical performance. The Preferred Approach in Defining the Project Make rough top-down estimates Develop the WBS/OBS Make bottom-up estimates Develop schedules and budgets Reconcile differences between top-down and bottom-up estimates Methods for Estimating Project Times and CostsTop-Down Approaches Consensus Method: use experience of senior and/or middle managers to estimate Ratio Method: use number of square feet to estimate the cost and time to build a house Apportion Method: an extension to the ratio method. Foundation might represent 3% of the total loan, framing 25%, plumbing and heating 15%, etc. Function Point Methods for Software and System Projects: using a regression formula derived from data of past projects Learning Curves: The time to perform a task improves with repetition Bottom-Up Approaches Template Method: If the project is similar to past projects. Parametric Procedures Applied to Specific Tasks: a cost of $7 per square yard of wallpaper. Range Estimating: Require three time estimates—low, average, and high (probability distributions). Get risk level from (high - low) A Hybrid: Phase Estimating Level of DetailA frequent rule of thumb used by practicing project managers says that a task duration should not exceed 5 workdays or at the most 10 workdays, if workdays are the time units used for the project. Types of Costs Direct costs Labor Materials Equipment Other Direct project overhead costs salary of the project manager temporary rental space for the project team supplies specialized machinery General and administrative (G&amp;A) overhead costs Advertising accounting salary of senior management above the project level Refining EstimatesReasons for adjusting estimates Interaction costs are hidden in estimates: each task estimate is supposed to be done independently. However, tasks are rarely completed in a vacuum. Normal conditions do not apply: availability of resources. Resource shortages, whether in the form of people, equipment, or materials. Things go wrong on projects: extreme weather conditions occur, accidents happen Project scope and plans change. People are overly optimistic. People engage in strategic misrepresentation: promoters underestimate the costs of projects and overestimate project benefits in order to win approval. Creating a Database for EstimatingCollect and archive data on past project estimates and actuals Mega Projects: A Special CaseA “white elephant” suggests a valuable, but burdensome, possession, which its owner cannot easily dispose of and whose cost (particularly upkeep) is out of proportion with its usefulness. The Reference Class Forecasting (RCF)Three Major Steps: Select a reference class of projects similar to your potential project. Collect and arrange outcome data as a distribution. Create a distribution of cost overruns as a percentage of the original project estimate (low to high). Use the distribution data to arrive at a realistic forecast. Compare the original cost estimate for the project with the reference class projects Benefits: Outside empirical data mitigates human bias. Politics, strategic, and promoter forces have difficulty ignoring outside RCF information. RCF serves as a reality check for funding large projects. RCF helps executives avoid unsound optimism. RCF leads to improved accountability. RCF provides a basis for project contingency funds. Developing a Project ScheduleDeveloping the Project Network Is a graphic flow chart depicting the project activities that must be completed, the logical sequences, the interdependencies of the activities to be completed, and the times for the activities to start and finish along with the longest path(s) through the network—the critical path. Provides the basis for scheduling labor and equipment. Enhances communication among project stakeholders. Provides an estimate of project duration. Provides the basis for budgeting the cash flow. Identifies which activities are “critical” and should not be delayed. Highlights which activities to consider for compressing the project duration. Helps managers get and stay on the project plan. From Work Package to NetworkProject networks are developed from the WBS. The project network is a visual flow diagram of the sequence, interrelationships, and dependencies of all the activities that must be accomplished to complete the project. Constructing a Project NetworkTerminology Activity: an element of the project that requires time but may not require resources Parallel activities: activities that can take place at the same time, if desired. Burst activity: an activity that has more than one activity immediately following it (more that one dependency arrow flowing from it) Merge activity: an activity that has more than one activity immediately preceding it (more than one dependency arrow flowing to it) Path: a sequence of connected, dependent activities Critical path: the path with the longest duration through the network Two approaches Activity-on-Node (AON) uses a node to depict an activity. Activity-on-Arrow (AOA) uses an arrow to depict an activity. Basic Rules to Follow in Developing Project Networks Networks flow typically from left to right. An activity cannot begin until all preceding connected activities have been completed. Arrows on networks indicate precedent and flow and can cross over each other. Each activity should have a unique identification number. An activity identification number must be greater than that of any activities that precede it. Looping is not allowed. Conditional statements are not allowed. Where there are multiple starts, a common start node can be used to indicate a clear project beginning on the network. Similarly, a single project end node can be used to indicate a clear ending. Activity-on-Node (AON) Fundamentals Which activities must be completed immediately before this activity? These activities are called predecessor activities. Which activities must immediately follow this activity? These activities are called successor activities. Which activities can occur while this activity is taking place? This is known as a concurrent or parallel relationship. Network Computation ProcessForward Pass—Earliest Times How soon can the activity start? (early start—ES) How soon can the activity finish? (early finish—EF) How soon can the project finish? (expected time—TE) Backward Pass—Latest Times How late can the activity start? (late start—LS) How late can the activity finish? (late finish—LF) Which activities represent the critical path? (critical path—CP) How long can the activity be delayed? (slack or float—SL) Forward Pass Computation Add activity times along each path in the network (ES + Duration = EF). Carry the early finish (EF) to the next activity where it becomes its early start (ES) unless… The next succeeding activity is a merge activity, in which case the largest early finish (EF) number of all its immediate predecessor activities is selected. Backward Pass Computation Subtract activity times along each path starting with the project end activity (LF – Duration = LS). Carry the late start (LS) to the next preceding activity where it becomes its late finish (LF) unless… The next succeeding activity is a burst activity, in which case the smallest late start (LS) number of all its immediate successor activities is selected. Determining Slack (or Float) Total Slack Tells us the amount of time an activity can be delayed and not delayed the project. Is how long an activity can exceed its early finish date without affecting the project end date or an imposed completion date. Is simply the difference between the LS and ES (LS – ES = SL) or between LF and EF (LF – EF = SL) Free Slack (Float) Is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying any immediately following (successor) activity. Is how long an activity can exceed its early finish date without affecting the early start dates of any successor(s). Allows flexibility in scheduling scarce resources. Occurs only activity at the end of a chain of activities, where you have a merge activity The Critical Path Is the network path(s) that has (have) the least slack in common. Is the longest path through the activity network. Is the shortest expected time in which the entire project can be completed. Is important because it impacts completion time. Is where you put best people on. Is where you pay extra attention when doing risk assessment. Is where you don’t look when other managers are asking to ‘borrow’ people or equipment. Is where you look when you don’t have time to monitor all activities Sensitivity Network sensitivity is the likelihood the original critical path(s) will change once the project is initiated. A network schedule that has only one critical path and noncritical activities that enjoy significant slack would be labeled ‘insensitive’. Practical Considerations Network Logic Errors: no Looping, no conditional statements. Activity Numbering: biger and biger, no repeat Use of Computers to Develop Networks (and Gantt Chart) Calendar Dates Multiple Starts and Multiple Projects: using a common start and end node helps to identify the total planning period of all projects Extended Network Techniques to Come Closer to RealityLadderingActivities are broken into segments so the following activity can begin sooner and not delay the work. Use of Lags to Reduce Schedule Detail and Project DurationFinish-to-Start Relationship Start-to-Start Relationship Hammock Activity Spans over a segment of a project. Has a duration that is determined after the network plan is drawn. Is very useful in assigning and controlling indirect project costs. Is used to aggregate sections of the project to facilitate getting the right level of detail for specific sections of a project.","link":"/blog/2024/10/24/About-Project-Management-Part-2/"},{"title":"About Project Management ( Part 3 )","text":"Managing RiskRisk Management ProcessRisk Defined: An uncertain event or condition that if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on project objectives. No amount of planning can overcome or control risk. Risk Management Defined: An attempt to recognize and manage potential and unforeseen trouble spots that may occur when the project is implemented. What can go wrong (risk event) How to minimize the risk event’s impact (consequences) What can be done before an event occurs (anticipation) What to do when an event occurs (contingency plans) Benefits of Risk Management A proactive rather than reactive approach Reduces surprises and negative consequences Prepares the project manager to take appropriate action Provides better control over the future Improves chances of reaching project objectives on time, within budget, and of meeting required performance. Risk Identification Generate a list of all the possible risks that could affect the project through brainstorming and other problem identifying techniques. Focus on the events that could produce consequences, not on project objectives. Use risk breakdown structure (RBS) in conjunction with work breakdown structure (WBS) to identify and analyze risks. Identify the macro risks first then specific areas can be checked. Use risk profile (a list of questions) to address traditional areas of uncertainty on a project. Risk Assessment Scenario analysis assesses the significance of each risk event in terms of probability and impact. Risk assessment form evaluates the severity, probability of risk events and its detection difficulty. Risk severity matrix prioritizes which risks to address. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) extends the risk severity matrix by including ease of detection in the equation: Risk Value = Impact x Probability x Detection Probability analysis uses statistical techniques in assessing project risk. Decision trees, net present value (NPV), program evaluation and review technique (PERT), PERT simulation Risk Response Development Mitigating Risk Reducing the likelihood that the event will occur Reducing the impact that the adverse event would have on the project Avoiding Risk Changing the project plan to eliminate the risk or condition Transferring Risk Passing risk to another party Examples: Fixed-price contracts, insurance, Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) provisions Escalating Risk Notifying the appropriate people within the organization of the threat Retaining Risk Making a conscious decision to accept the risk of an event occurring Contingency Planning Contingency Plan Defined Is an alternative plan that will be used if a possible foreseen risk event becomes a reality. Is a plan of action that will reduce or mitigate the negative impact of the risk event. Is not a part of the initial implementation plan and only goes into effect after the risk is recognized. Risks of the absence of a contingency plan Cause a manager to delay or postpone the decision to implement a remedy Lead to panic and acceptance of the first remedy suggested Make the decision making under pressure which can be dangerous and costly Risk and Contingency Planning Technical Risks Backup strategies if chosen technology fails Assess whether technical uncertainties can be resolved Schedule Risks Expedite or “crash” the project to get it back on track Schedule activities in parallel or use start-to-start lag relationships Use the best people for high-risk tasks Cost Risks Review price to avoid the trap of using one lump sum to cover price risks Funding Risks Evaluate the risk of reductions in funding—a cut in the project Opportunity ManagementAn opportunity is an event that can have positive impact on project objectives. Exploit Seek to eliminate the uncertainty associated with an opportunity to ensure that it definitely happens Share Allocate some or all of the ownership of an opportunity to another party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project Enhance Take action to increase the probability and/or the positive impact of an opportunity Escalate Notify the appropriate people within the organization of the opportunity Accept Be willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs, but not taking action to pursue it Contingency Funding and Time Buffers Contingency Funds Contingency reserves—cover identified risks Management reserves—cover unidentified risks Time Buffers: Are amounts of time used to cushion against potential delays in the project Add to activities with severe risks Add to merge activities that are prone to delays Add to noncritical activities to reduce the likelihood that they will create another critical path Add to activities that require scare resources Risk Response Control Risk Register: descriptions, category, probability of occurring, impact, responses, contingency plans, owners, and current status Risk Control Executing the risk response strategy Monitoring triggering events Initiating contingency plans Watching for new risks Establishing a Change Management System Monitoring, tracking, and reporting risk Fostering an open organization environment Repeating risk identification/assessment exercises Assigning and documenting responsibility for managing risk Change Control Management Sources of Change Project scope changes Implementation of contingency plans Improvement changes Change Management Systems Identify proposed changes. List expected effects of proposed change(s) on schedule and budget. Review, evaluate, and approve or disapprove changes formally. Negotiate and resolve conflicts of change, conditions, and cost. Communicate changes to the parties affected. Assign responsibility for implementing change. Adjust the master schedule and budget. Track all changes that are to be implemented Benefits of Change Control Systems Inconsequential changes are discouraged by the formal process. Costs of changes are maintained in a log. Integrity of the WBS and performance measures is maintained. Allocation and use of contingency and management reserves are tracked. Responsibility for implementation is clarified. Effect of changes is visible to all parties involved. Implementation of change is monitored. Scope changes will be quickly reflected in baseline and performance measures Scheduling Resources and CostsOverview of the Resource Scheduling ProblemResources and Priorities Project network times are not a schedule until resources have been assigned. There are always more project proposals than there are available resources. The project priority team will add a new project only if resources are available. Cost estimates are not a budget until they have been time-phased. Once resource assignments have been finalized, you are able to develop a baseline budget schedule for the project. The Resource Scheduling Problem Resource Smoothing: delaying non-critical activities (using slack). increase resource utilization. Resource-Constrained Scheduling: some activities must be delayed Types of Resource ConstraintsTechnical or Logical Constraints: Are related to the networked sequence in which project activities must occur. Resource Constraints: Occur when the absence, shortage, or unique interrelationship and interaction characteristics of resources require a particular sequencing of project activities. Note that the resource dependency takes priority over the technological dependency but does not violate the technological dependency Types of Resources Constraints: People Materials Equipment Classification of a Scheduling Problem Time-Constrained Project: resources can be added Resource-Constrained Project: If the resources are inadequate, it will be acceptable to delay the project. Resource Allocation Methods Limiting Assumptions Splitting activities will not be allowed. Level of resources used for an activity cannot be changed. Risk Assumptions Activities with the most slack pose the least risk. Reduction of flexibility does not increase risk. The nature of an activity (easy, complex) doesn’t increase risk. Time-Constrained Projects Must be completed by an imposed date. Focus on resource utilization. Require use of resource smoothing techniques that balance demand for a resource Smoothing Resource Techniques: Delay noncritical activities by using positive slack to reduce peak demand and fill in the valleys for the resources without delaying the entire project Goals Reduce the peak of demand for the resource Reduce the number of resources over the life of the project Minimize the fluctuation in resource demand Downside Loss of flexibility that occurs from reducing slack Creates more critical activities and/or near-critical activities because of slack reduction Resource-Constrained Projectspriority rules: Minimum slack: will not inflence others Smallest (least) duration: release resource early Lowest activity identification number: logically parallel method: when the resources needed exceed the resources available, retains activities first by the priority rules. The Impacts of Resource-Constrained Scheduling: Reduces slack; reduce flexibility Increases the number of critical and near-critical activities Increases scheduling complexity because resource constraints are added to technical constraints May make the traditional critical path no longer meaningful Can break the sequence and leave the network with a set of disjointed critical activities May cause parallel activities to become sequential Can change activities from critical to noncritical Computer Demonstration of ResourceConstrained SchedulingMS project Splitting ActivitiesSplitting Tasks Is a scheduling technique used to get a better project schedule and/or to increase resource utilization. Involves interrupting the work and sending the resource to another activity for a period of time and then having the resource resume work on the original activity. Can be useful if the work involved does not include large start-up or shut-down costs. Is considered a major reason why projects fail to meet schedule. Benefits of Scheduling Resources Leaves time for considering reasonable alternatives Cost-time tradeoffs Changes in priorities Provides the information needed to prepare time-phased work package budgets with dates To gauge the impact of unforeseen events To assess how much flexibility over certain resources Assigning Project Work Reasons why we should not always assign the best people the most difficult tasks Best people: resent to the fact that they are always given the toughest assignments Less experienced participants: resent to the fact that they are never given the opportunity to expand their skill/knowledge base Factors to be considered in deciding who should work together Minimize unnecessary tension; complement each other Experience: veterans team up with new hires Future needs: have people work together early on so that they can become familiar with each other Multiproject Resource SchedulesProblems: Delays in one project create delays for other projects Inefficient resource utilization: Different schedules and requirements by multiple projects create the peaks and valleys in overall resource demands Resource bottlenecks: Shortages of critical resources required by multiple projects cause delays and schedule extensions. Approach: Create project offices or departments to oversee the scheduling of resources across multiple projects Use a project priority queuing system—first come, first served for resources Treat individual projects as part of one big project and adapt the scheduling heuristics to this “mega project” Utilize project management software to prioritize resource allocation Outsource projects to reduce the number of projects managing internally Hire temporary workers to expedite certain activities that are falling behind schedule Contract project work during peak periods when there are insufficient internal resources to meet the demands of all project Using the Resource Schedule to Develop a Project Cost Baseline Why a Time-Phased Budget Baseline Is Needed To determine if the project is on, ahead, or behind schedule and over or under its budgeted costs To assess how much work has been accomplished for the allocated money spent—the project cost baseline (planned value, PV) Creating a Time-Phased Budget Assign each work package to one responsible person or department and deliverable Compare planned schedule and costs using an integrative system called earned value Generate cash flow statements and resource usage schedules Reducing Project DurationRationale for Reducing Project DurationCrash: shortening the duration of an activity or a project beyond when it normally can be done. Reasons for attempting to reduce the duration of a project are: Time-to-market pressures Unforeseen delays Incentive contracts (bonuses for early completion) Imposed deadlines and contract commitments Overhead costs Pressure to reassign resources to other projects Options for Accelerating Project CompletionResources Are Not Constrained Add resources Outsource project work Schedule overtime Establish a core project team Do it twice—fast and correctly Resources Are Constrained Improve project team efficiency Fast tracking Use critical-chain management Reduce project scope Compromise quality Project Cost-Duration GraphExplanation of Project Costs Project Indirect Costs Are costs that cannot be associated with any particular work package or activity ( overhead supervision, administration, consultants, and interest ). Are costs that vary directly with time. Project Direct Costs Are costs that assigned directly to a work package and activity ( labor, materials, equipment, subcontractors ). Represent normal costs (low-cost, efficient methods for a normal time). Constructing a Project Cost-Duration Graph Determining the Activities to ShortenWhich activities to shorten?Look for critical activities that can be shortened with the smallest increase in cost per unit of time. Assumptions: The cost-time relationship is linear. Normal time assumes low-cost, efficient methods to complete the activity. Crash time represents a limit—the greatest time reduction possible under realistic conditions. Slope represents cost per unit of time. All accelerations must occur within the normal and crash times. Cost-Duration Trade-off Example What If Cost, Not Time, Is the Issue?Commonly used options for cutting costs are: Reduce project scope Have owner take on more responsibility Outsource project activities or even the entire project Brainstorm cost savings options Being an Effective Project ManageManaging versus Leading a ProjectManaging—coping with complexity Formulate plans and objectives Monitor results Take corrective action Expedite activities Solve technical problems Serve as peacemaker Make tradeoffs among time, costs, and project scope Leading—coping with change Recognize the need to change to keep the project on track Initiate change Provide direction and motivation Innovate and adapt as necessary Integrate assigned resources Engaging Project StakeholdersStakeholders are people and organizations that are actively involved in the project or whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by the project. Project Management Maxims: You can’t do it all and get it all done. Projects usually involve a vast web of relationships. Hands-on work is not the same as leading. More pressure and more involvement can reduce your effectiveness as a leader. What’s important to you likely isn’t as important to someone else. Different groups have different stakes (responsibilities, agendas, and priorities) in the outcome of a project. Influence as ExchangeYou scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours Commonly Traded Organizational CurrenciesTask-related currencies Resources Lending or giving money, budget increases, personnel, etc. Assistance Helping with existing projects or undertaking unwanted tasks. Cooperation Giving task support, providing quicker response time, or aiding implementation. Information Providing organizational as well as technical knowledge. Position-related currencies Advancement Giving a task or assignment that can result in promotion. Recognition Acknowledging effort, accomplishments, or abilities. Visibility Providing a chance to be known by higher-ups or significant others in the organization. Network/contacts Providing opportunities for linking with others. Inspiration-related currencies Vision Being involved in a task that has larger significance for the unit, organization, customer, or society. Excellence Having a chance to do important things really well. Ethical correctness Doing what is “right” by a higher standard than efficiency. Relationship-related currencies Acceptance Providing closeness and friendship. Personal support Giving personal and emotional backing. Understanding Listening to others’ concerns and issues. Personal-related currencies Challenge/learning Sharing tasks that increase skills and abilities. Ownership/involvement Letting others have ownership and influence. Gratitude Expressing appreciation. Social Network BuildingMapping Stakeholder Dependencies Project team’s perspective Whose cooperation will we need? Whose agreement or approval will we need? Whose opposition would keep us from accomplishing the project? Stakeholder’s perspective What differences exist between the team and the people on whom the team depends? How do the stakeholders view the project? What is the current status of the relationship the team has with the stakeholders? What sources of influence does the team have relative to the stakeholders on whom the team depends? Management by Wandering Around (MBWA) Management by Wandering Around (MBWA) involves managers spending the majority of their time outside their offices in order to have face-to-face interactions with employees building cooperativerelationships. Relationships should be built before they are needed. Characteristics of Effective Project Managers Initiate contact with key stakeholders to keep abreast of developments Anticipate potential problems Provide encouragement Reinforce the objectives and vision of the project Intervene to resolve conflicts and prevent stalemates from occurring Managing Upward RelationsProject success is strongly affected by the degree to which a project has the support of top management. Top management must: Provide an appropriate budget Be responsive to unexpected needs Send a clear signal to others in the organization of the importance of the project and the need to cooperate Rescind unreasonable demand Provide additional resources Recognize the accomplishments of team members Ethics and Project ManagementEthical Dilemmas—situations where it is difficult to determine whether conduct is right or wrong Padding of cost and time estimations Exaggerating pay-offs of project proposals Falsely assuring customers that everything is on track Being pressured to alter status reports Falsifying cost accounts Compromising safety standards to accelerate progress Approving shoddy work Building Trust: The Key to Exercising Influence Trust Is an elusive concept. Is a function of character (personal motives) and competence (skills necessary to realize motives). Is sustained through frequent face-to-face contact. The core of highly effective people is a character ethic. Consistency — more predictable Openness — more receptive to others A sense of purpose — what is best for the organization and the project Qualities of an Effective Project Manager Summary Effective communication skills Systems thinking Personal integrity Proactivity High emotional intelligence (EQ) General business perspective Effective time management Optimism Contradictions of Project Management Innovate and maintain stability See the big picture while getting their hands dirty Encourage individuals but stress the team Be hands-off/hands-on Be flexible but firm Manage team versus organizational loyalties Managing Project TeamsThe Five-Stage Team Development Model Situational Factors Affecting Team DevelopmentConditions Favoring Development of High-Performing Project Teams There are 10 or fewer members per team. Members volunteer to serve on the project team. Members serve on the project from beginning to end. Members are assigned to the project full time. Members are part of an organization culture that fosters cooperation and trust. Members report solely to the project manager. All relevant functional areas are represented on the team. The project involves a compelling objective. Members are located within conversational distance of each other. Building High-Performance Project TeamsConsiderations that need to be factored into the recruitment process Problem-solving ability Availability Technological expertise Credibility Political connections Ambition, initiative, and energy Familiarity Conducting project meeting The first project team meeting—project kick-off meeting Establishing ground rules Planning decisions Tracking decisions Managing change decisions Relationship decisions Managing subsequent project meetings Establishing Team Norms Confidentiality is maintained; no information is shared outside the team unless all agree to it. It is acceptable to be in trouble, but it is not acceptable to surprise others. Tell others immediately when deadlines or milestones will not be reached. There is zero tolerance for bulling a way through a problem or an issue. Agree to disagree, but when a decision has been made, regardless of personal feelings, move forward. Respect outsiders, and do not flaunt one’s position on the project team. Hard work does not get in the way of having fun. Establishing a Team Identity Effective use of meetings Co-location of team members Creation of project name Get the team to build or do something together early on Team rituals Managing Project Reward Systems The reward system encourages team performance and extra effort. Most project managers advocate the use of group rewards. To increase the value of rewards, rewards need to have lasting significance. Some project managers have to use negative reinforcement to motivate project performance. There are times when we need to reward individual performance. Examples of this kind of rewards include: Letter of recommendation Public recognition for outstanding work Job assignments Flexibility Group Decision-Making Process: Identifying problems Generating alternatives Reaching a decision Following up Managing Conflict within the Project Encouraging Functional Conflict: obtaining a deeper understanding of the issues and coming up with the best decisions possible Managing Dysfunctional Conflict Mediate the conflict Arbitrate the conflict Control the conflict Accept the conflict Eliminate the conflict Managing Virtual Project TeamsTwo biggest challenges involved in managing a virtual project team are Developing trust Hold a face-to-face meeting at the beginning and orchestrate the exchange of social information Set clear roles for each team member Form teams with people who have already worked effectively together on projects, if possible Developing effective patterns of communication Don’t let team members vanish Establish a code of conduct to avoid delays Establish clear norms and protocols for surfacing assumptions and conflicts Use electronic video technology to verify work Share the pain Project Team Pitfalls Groupthink Illusion of invulnerability Whitewash of critical thinking Negative stereotypes of outsiders Direct pressure Bureaucratic bypass syndrome Team spirit becomes team infatuation","link":"/blog/2024/11/14/About-Project-Management-Part-3/"},{"title":"About Project Management ( Part 4 )","text":"OutsourcingOutsourcing Project WorkAdvantages of Outsourcing Cost reduction: Outsourcing can lead to significant cost savings, as it allows companies to leverage lower labor costs in other countries. Focus on Core Competencies: Outsourcing non-core activities allows companies to focus on their primary business functions. Access to Expertise: Outsourcing to specialized service providers can provide access to expertise that may not be readily available within the organization. Scalability: Outsourcing can facilitate scalability, as service providers can quickly increase or decrease resources as needed. Risk Management: Outsourcing can help manage risks associated with new or untested technologies or markets. Disadvantages of Outsourcing Coordination breakdown: Communication and coordination challenges can arise when working with offshore teams, leading to misunderstandings and delays. Loss of Control: Outsourcing involves transferring control over certain aspects of the project to an external provider. Conflict Security issues: Outsourcing sensitive data or intellectual property to foreign countries may raise security concerns. Political hot potato: Outsourcing can make a company a target for political or social unrest in the host country.

Is based on four key points. Separate the people from the problem Focus on interests, not positions Invent options for mutual gains When possible, use objective criteria Dealing with Unreasonable People When the other person begins to push, don’t push back. Ask questions instead of making statements. Invite criticism and advice instead of defending your ideas. Use silence as a response to an unreasonable proposal. Have a strong best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA). A strong BATNA gives you the power to walk away and say, “No deal unless we work toward a win/win scenario.” A Note on Managing Customer Relations Bad news travel faster and farther than good news. Project managers need to cultivate positive working relations with clients to preserve their reputations. Customer satisfaction is a function of the extent to which perceived performance (or outcome) exceeds expectations. The met-expectation model of customer satisfaction highlights the point that whether a client is dissatisfied or delighted with a project is not based on hard facts and objective data but on perceptions and expectations. Project managers must be skilled at managing customer expectations and perceptions. Managing Customer Expectations Avoid the temptation to oversell the virtues of a project to win approval. Lower customer expectations by underselling projects. Work closely with the client organization to develop a well-defined project scope statement. Share significant risks or potential problems that might disrupt project execution. Keep customers abreast of project progress. Handle customer interactions, unexpected problems and setbacks with a competent and professional manner. Speak with one voice. ( Avoiding Visible Internal Disputes ) Procurement Management Process Planning purchases and acquisitions Planning contracting Requesting seller responses Selecting sellers Administering the contract Closing the contract Fixed-Price Contracts The contractor agrees to perform all work specified in the contract at a fixed price. Fixed-price contracts are preferred by both owners and contractors when the scope of the project is well defined with predictable costs and low implementation risks. The disadvantage of a fixed-price contract for owners is that it is more difficult and more costly to prepare. The primary disadvantages of a fixed-price contract for contractors is that they run the risk of underestimating. Contracts with long lead times such as construction and production projects may include escalation provisions that protect the contractor against external cost increases in materials, labor rates, or overhead expenses. Cost-Plus Contracts The contractor is reimbursed for all direct allowable costs (materials, labor, travel) plus an additional fee to cover overhead and profit. Unlike fixed-price contracts, cost-plus contracts put the burden of risk on the client. The contract does not indicate what the project is going to cost until the end of the project. The inherent weakness of cost-plus contracts has been compensated for by a variety of incentive clauses directed at providing incentives to contractors to control costs, maintain performance, and avoid schedule overruns. Contract Change Control System Defines the process by which the contract may be modified. Includes the paperwork tracking systems dispute resolution procedures approval levels necessary for authorizing changes Monitoring ProgressStructure of a Project Monitoring Information SystemA project monitoring system involves Determining what data to collect Determining how, when, and who will collect the data Analysis of the data Reporting current progress What Data Are Collected?The data need to answer questions such as What is the current status of the project in terms of schedule and cost? How much will it cost to complete the project? When will the project be completed? Are there potential problems that need to be addressed now? What, who, and where are the causes for cost or schedule overruns? If there is a cost overrun midway in the project, can we forecast the overrun at completion? Collecting Data and Analysis Will the data be collected by the project team, contractor, independent cost engineers, project manager? Will the data be derived electronically from some form of surrogate data? Should the reporting period be one hour, one day, one week, or what? Is there a central repository for the data collected and is someone responsible for its dissemination? Reports and Reporting Who gets the progress reports? How will the reports be transmitted? When will the reports be distributed? A common topic format for progress reports: Progress since last report Current status of project: 1.schedule, 2.cost, 3.scope Cumulative trends Problems and issues since last report: 1. Actions and resolutions of earlier problems 2. New variances and problems identified Corrective action planned The Project Control ProcessControlIs the process of comparing actual performance against plan to identify deviations, evaluate possible alternative courses of actions, and take appropriate corrective action. Project control steps for measuring and evaluating project performance Setting a baseline plan Measuring progress and performance Comparing plan against actual Taking action Monitoring Time PerformanceTypical tools used for communicating project schedule status Gantt chart (bar chart) is the most favored, used, and understandable. It is commonly referred to as a tracking Gantt chart. Control chart is used to plot the difference between the scheduled and actual times on the critical path at a given point on the project. Milestone schedules are often used to keep more distal stakeholders informed on the progress of a project. Milestones are significant project events that mark major accomplishments. Earned Value Management (EVM) Is a methodology that combines scope, schedule, and resource measurement to assess project performance and progress. Was pioneered by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1960s. Uses several acronyms and equations for analysis. Uses data developed from the work breakdown structure, project network, and schedule. Starts with the time-phased costs that provide the project budget baseline, which is called the planned budgeted value of the work scheduled (PV). Then comparisons can be made with actual and planned schedule and costs. Term Definition EV Earned value for a task is the budgeted value of the work accomplished. Work accomplished is often measured in terms of percentages (e.g., 25% complete) in which case, EV is simply percent complete times its original budget. [The older acronym for this value was BCWP—budgeted cost of the work performed.] PV The planned time-phased baseline of the value of the work scheduled. An approved cost estimate of the resources scheduled in a time-phased cumulative baseline [BCWS—budgeted cost of the work scheduled]. AC Actual cost of the work completed. The sum of the costs incurred in accomplishing work [ACWP—actual cost of the work performed]. CV Cost variance is the difference between the earned value and the actual costs for the work completed to date where CV = EV − AC. SV Schedule variance is the difference between the earned value and the baseline to date where SV = EV − PV. BAC Budgeted cost at completion. The total budgeted cost of the baseline or project cost accounts. EAC Estimated cost at completion ETC Estimated cost to complete remaining work VAC Cost variance at completion. VAC indicates expected actual over- or underrun cost at completion. Developing an Integrated Cost/Schedule System Define the work using a WBS. Scope Work package Deliverables Organization units Resources Budgets for each work package Develop work and resource schedule. Schedule resources to activities Time-phase work packages into a network Develop a time-phased budget using work packages included in an activity called the planned budgeted cost of the work scheduled (PV). At the work package level, collect the actual costs for the work performed called the actual cost of the work completed (AC). Multiple percent complete with the original budget amount to be earned value (EV). Compute the schedule variance (SV = EV – PV) and cost variance (CV = EV – AC). Development of Project BaselinePurposes of a Baseline (PV) To measure and report progress To estimate cash flow Rules in Assigning Costs to the Baseline Costs are placed (time-phased) in the baseline exactly as managers expected them to be “earned.” Percent complete is the workhorse most commonly used. Someone familiar with each task estimates what percent of the task has been completed or how much of the task remains. What Costs Are Included in Baselines? Baseline is the sum of the cost accounts and each cost account is the sum of the work packages in the cost account. Three direct costs are typically included in baselines—labor, equipment, and materials Methods of Variance AnalysisComparing earned value with The expected schedule value The actual costs Assessing current status of a project requires three data elements Planned cost of the work scheduled (PV) Budgeted cost of the work completed (EV) Actual cost of the work completed (AC) Computing schedule variance (SV) and cost variance (CV) A positive variance indicates a desirable condition, while a negative variance suggests problems or changes that have taken place. VariancesCost variance (CV) = EV – AC Tells us if the work accomplished costs more or less than was planned at any point over the life of the project. Schedule variance (SV) = EV – PV Presents an overall assessment of all work packages in the project scheduled to date. Contains no critical path information. Measures progress in dollars rather than time units. Variance at completion (VAC) = BAC – EAC Suggests whether the costs at completion of the project will differ from what was planned. Developing a Status Report: A Hypothetical ExampleAssumptions Each cost account has only one work package, and each cost account will be represented as an activity on the network. The project network early start times will serve as the basis for assigning the baseline values. From the moment work on an activity task begins, some actual costs will be incurred each period until the activity is completed. Indexes to Monitor ProgressPerformance Indexes Cost performance index (CPI) = EV/AC Measures cost efficiency of the work accomplished to date Scheduling performance index (SPI) = EV/PV Measures scheduling efficiency to date Project Percent Complete Indexes Percent complete index budgeted costs (PCIB) = EV/BAC Percent complete index actual costs (PCIC) = AC/EAC Management reserve index (MRI) = CV/MR Is popular in the construction industry Reflects the amount of management reserves that has been absorbed by cost overruns. Additional Earned Value RulesRules applied to short-duration activities and/or small-cost activities 0/100 rule: Assumes 100% of the budget is earned when the work package is completed. 50/50 rule: Allows 50% of the value of the work package budget to be earned when it is started and 50% to be earned when the package is completed. Rule used gates before the total budgeted value of an activity can be claimed Percent complete with weighted monitoring gates: Uses subjective estimated percent complete in combination with hard, tangible monitoring points. Forecasting Final Project CostTwo methods used to revise estimates of future project costs Revised estimated cost at completion (EACre) Allows experts in the field to change original baseline durations and costs because new information tells them the original estimates are not accurate. Forecasted total cost at completion (EACf) Uses the actual costs to date plus an efficiency index (CPI=EV/AC) applied to the remaining project work. Forecasting Models: EACre and EACf Revised estimated cost at completion (EACre) = AC + ETCre AC = cumulative actual cost of work completed to date ETCre = revised estimated cost to complete remaining work Forecasted total cost at completion (EACf) = ETC + AC = Work remaining / CPI + AC = (BAC − EV)/(EV/AC) + AC where: ETC = estimated cost to complete remaining work AC = cumulative actual cost of work completed to date CPI = cumulative cost index to date BAC = total budget of the baseline EV = cumulative budgeted cost of work completed to date Another Forecasting IndexTo Complete Performance Index (TCPI) = (BAC − EV) / (BAC − AC) Used as a supplement to the estimate at completion (EACf) computation. Measures the amount of value each remaining dollar in the budget must earn to stay within the budget. A ratio less than 1.00 indicates an ability to complete the project without using all of the remaining budget. 13.8 Other Control Issues Technical performance measurement is as important as measuring schedule and cost performance. Scope creep causes problems because the “minor refinements” eventually build to be major scope changes. Baseline changes should be allowed only if it is clear that the project will fail without the change, the project will be improved significantly with the change, or the customer wants it and will pay for it. Data acquisition is time consuming and costly. AgileTraditional versus Agile Methods Traditional Project Management Approach Concentrates on thorough, up front planning of the entire project. Requires a high degree of predictability to be effective. Agile Project Management (Agile PM) Relies on iterative, incremental development (IID). Is ideal for exploratory projects in which requirements need to be discovered and new technology tested. Focuses on active collaboration between the project team and customers representatives, breaking projects into small, functional pieces and adapting to changing requirements. A Set of 12 Guiding Principles for Agile PM Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. Working software is the primary measure of progress. Agile processes promote sustainable development. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then turns and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Agile PM Utilizes a rolling wave planning and scheduling project methodology. Is continuously developed through a series of incremental iterations over time. Iterations are short time frames (“time boxes”). The goal of each iteration is to develop a workable product that satisfies one or more desired product features to demonstrate to the customer and other key stakeholders. At the end of each iteration, stakeholders and customers review progress and re-evaluate priorities to ensure alignment with customer needs and company goals. Each new iteration subsumes the work of the previous iterations and adds new capabilities to the evolving product Advantages of Iterative Development Process Continuous integration, verification, and validation of the evolving product. Frequent demonstration of progress to increase the likelihood that the end product will satisfy customer needs. Early detection of defects and problems. Agile Principles Focus on customer value Iterative and incremental delivery Experimentation and adaptation Self-organization Servant leadership Continuous improvement Agile PM in Action: Scrum Is a holistic approach to developing new products, where the whole team “tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth.” Begins with a high-level scope definition and ballpark time and cost estimates for the project. Use product features as deliverables. A feature is defined as a piece of a product that delivers some useful functionality to a customer. The project team tackles the highest-priority feasible feature first. Priorities are re-evaluated after each iteration. Iterations are called sprints and should last no longer than four weeks. The goal of each sprint is to produce fully functional features. Specific features are created according to four distinct phases: analysis, design, build, and test. Key Roles and Responsibilities in the Scrum ProcessProduct Owner Acts on behalf of customers/end users to represent their interests. Works with the development team to refine features through stories and end users cases. Ensures that the development team focuses their efforts on developing a product that will fulfill the business objective of the project. Development Team Is responsible for delivering the product. Is typically made up of five to nine people with cross-functional skill sets. Scrum Master (Project Manager) Facilitates the scrum process and resolves impediments at the team and organization levels. Acts as buffer between the team and outside interference but not the leader of team (the team leads itself!) Helps the product owner with planning and try to keep the team energized. Scrum Artifacts Product Backlog Definition: The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of all the features, requirements, enhancements, and bug fixes that might be needed for the product. It is essentially a “wish list” of everything the team could work on. Ownership: Managed by the Product Owner, who ensures it reflects the product vision and priorities. Scope: Covers the entire project or product lifecycle. Content: Includes high-level features or user stories, detailed items, and technical improvements. Dynamic Nature: Continuously evolves and adapts based on changing customer needs, feedback, and business priorities. Purpose: Serves as the single source of truth for work to be done on the product. Sprint Backlog Definition: The Sprint Backlog is a subset of the Product Backlog, containing items that the team commits to completing during a specific sprint. Ownership: Managed by the Development Team, as they are responsible for planning and delivering the work. Scope: Focused on the current sprint, usually spanning 1-4 weeks. Content: Includes selected Product Backlog items, detailed tasks to complete them, and technical work like bug fixes or improvements. Static During Sprint: Unlike the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog is not supposed to change once the sprint starts (except in rare cases) Extreme Programming(XP) and KanbanExtreme Programming- Is a more aggressive form of Scrum that organizes people to produce higher-quality software more efficiently. - Considers change a natural, even desirable aspect of software development projects and should be planned for, instead of eliminated. - Are test-driven development and paired programming. - Is founded on five values: communication, simplicity, feedback, courage and respect. Kanban Is a lean management methodology that has been adapted by Agile practitioners to help manage project work flow. Consists of a whiteboard divided into three columns: Planned, Work in Progress, and Done. Is based on the idea of a pull system—signaling when the team is ready for more work. Helps the team visualize the work flow on the project and focus their attention on the most critical work. Applying Agile PM to Large ProjectsScaling Involves several teams working on different features at the same time. Needs to make sure that the different features being created work in harmony with each other—integration. Staging Requires significant up-front planning to manage the interdependences of different features that will be developed. Involves developing protocols and defining roles for coordinating efforts and assuring compatibility Limitations and Concerns Agile PM is not a simple methodology. Adoption tends to evolve over time. Many of the Agile principles, including self-organizing teams and intense collaboration, are incompatible with corporate cultures. Agile PM does not satisfy top management’s need for control. Agile skeptics warn that evolving requirements contribute to scope creep. Agile PM requires active customer involvement. Hybrid Models Agile PM is used up front to resolve key scope questions and define requirements. Then traditional PM is applied to complete the project. Incremental, experimentation is used to resolve technical issues, allowing for a formal implementation plan. Many companies use hybrid models on large projects that combine waterfall and Agile methods. Teams use Agile techniques on plan-driven projects. Teams use shorter iterations and retrospectives to get critical customer feedback. Kanban methods are used by traditional teams to visualize work and identify bottlenecks in the project schedule.","link":"/blog/2024/12/04/About-Project-Management-Part-4/"},{"title":"Chrome Extension","text":"Chrome Extension manifest.json build parcel request https aws load balance","link":"/blog/2024/10/20/Chrome-Extension/"},{"title":"About My Previous Blog","text":"For those who have followed my previous blog hosted at kongchenglc.github.io, I would like to let you know that it is no longer actively maintained.
