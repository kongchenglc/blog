Types of EstimatesTop-down (macro) estimates Analogy Group consensus Mathematical relationships Bottom-up (micro) estimates based on estimates of elements found in the work breakdown structure Why Estimating Time and Cost Is Important To support good decisions. To schedule work. To determine how long the project should take and its cost. To determine whether the project is worth doing. To develop cash flow needs. To determine how well the project is progressing. different aspects of estimating Range Accuracy Precision Confidence Factors Influencing the Quality of Estimates Planning Horizon: cost estimates for a party you are organizing this weekend should be much more accurate than the estimates for a party that will take place in six months. Project Complexity People: How familiar are they with the task they are estimating? Project Structure and Organization: In a matrix environment may take longer, since attention is divided and coordination demands. Padding Estimates: Most of us are inclined to add a little padding to reduce the risk of being late Organizational Culture Others: Equipment downtime, National holidays, vacations, etc. Estimating Guidelines for Times, Costs, and Resources Responsibility: estimates should be made by the person(s) most familiar with the task. The use of several people to estimate: leads to consensus and eliminate extreme estimate errors Normal conditions: based on certain assumptions. Estimates should be based on normal conditions, efficient methods, and a normal level of resources Time units: All task time estimates need consistent time units. Eg: calendar days, workdays, workweeks, person days, single shift, hours, minutes, etc. Independence: treat each task as independent of other tasks. To avoid some rough “guesstimate” of the total time for the whole path Contingencies: Work package estimates should not include allowances for contingencies. Risk assessment: to avoid surprises to stakeholders. Simply identifying the degree of risk Top-Down versus Bottom-Up EstimatingTop-Down Estimates Are usually derived from someone who uses experience and/or information to determine the project duration and total cost. Are sometimes made by top managers who have very little knowledge of the component activities used to complete the project. Bottom-Up Estimates Can take place after the project has been defined in detail. Can serve as a check on cost elements in the WBS by rolling up the work packages and associated cost accounts to major deliverables. Provide the customer with an opportunity to see various trade-offs in different project scenarios, such as time, cost, resources, and technical performance. The Preferred Approach in Defining the Project Make rough top-down estimates Develop the WBS/OBS Make bottom-up estimates Develop schedules and budgets Reconcile differences between top-down and bottom-up estimates Methods for Estimating Project Times and CostsTop-Down Approaches Consensus Method: use experience of senior and/or middle managers to estimate Ratio Method: use number of square feet to estimate the cost and time to build a house Apportion Method: an extension to the ratio method. Foundation might represent 3% of the total loan, framing 25%, plumbing and heating 15%, etc. Function Point Methods for Software and System Projects: using a regression formula derived from data of past projects Learning Curves: The time to perform a task improves with repetition Bottom-Up Approaches Template Method: If the project is similar to past projects. Parametric Procedures Applied to Specific Tasks: a cost of $7 per square yard of wallpaper. Range Estimating: Require three time estimates—low, average, and high (probability distributions). Get risk level from (high - low) A Hybrid: Phase Estimating Level of DetailA frequent rule of thumb used by practicing project managers says that a task duration should not exceed 5 workdays or at the most 10 workdays, if workdays are the time units used for the project. Types of Costs Direct costs Labor Materials Equipment Other Direct project overhead costs salary of the project manager temporary rental space for the project team supplies specialized machinery General and administrative (G&amp;A) overhead costs Advertising accounting salary of senior management above the project level Refining EstimatesReasons for adjusting estimates Interaction costs are hidden in estimates: each task estimate is supposed to be done independently. However, tasks are rarely completed in a vacuum. Normal conditions do not apply: availability of resources. Resource shortages, whether in the form of people, equipment, or materials. Things go wrong on projects: extreme weather conditions occur, accidents happen Project scope and plans change. People are overly optimistic. People engage in strategic misrepresentation: promoters underestimate the costs of projects and overestimate project benefits in order to win approval. Creating a Database for EstimatingCollect and archive data on past project estimates and actuals Mega Projects: A Special CaseA “white elephant” suggests a valuable, but burdensome, possession, which its owner cannot easily dispose of and whose cost (particularly upkeep) is out of proportion with its usefulness. The Reference Class Forecasting (RCF)Three Major Steps: Select a reference class of projects similar to your potential project. Collect and arrange outcome data as a distribution. Create a distribution of cost overruns as a percentage of the original project estimate (low to high). Use the distribution data to arrive at a realistic forecast. Compare the original cost estimate for the project with the reference class projects Benefits: Outside empirical data mitigates human bias. Politics, strategic, and promoter forces have difficulty ignoring outside RCF information. RCF serves as a reality check for funding large projects. RCF helps executives avoid unsound optimism. RCF leads to improved accountability. RCF provides a basis for project contingency funds. Developing a Project ScheduleDeveloping the Project Network Is a graphic flow chart depicting the project activities that must be completed, the logical sequences, the interdependencies of the activities to be completed, and the times for the activities to start and finish along with the longest path(s) through the network—the critical path. Provides the basis for scheduling labor and equipment. Enhances communication among project stakeholders. Provides an estimate of project duration. Provides the basis for budgeting the cash flow. Identifies which activities are “critical” and should not be delayed. Highlights which activities to consider for compressing the project duration. Helps managers get and stay on the project plan. From Work Package to NetworkProject networks are developed from the WBS. The project network is a visual flow diagram of the sequence, interrelationships, and dependencies of all the activities that must be accomplished to complete the project. Constructing a Project NetworkTerminology Activity: an element of the project that requires time but may not require resources Parallel activities: activities that can take place at the same time, if desired. Burst activity: an activity that has more than one activity immediately following it (more that one dependency arrow flowing from it) Merge activity: an activity that has more than one activity immediately preceding it (more than one dependency arrow flowing to it) Path: a sequence of connected, dependent activities Critical path: the path with the longest duration through the network Two approaches Activity-on-Node (AON) uses a node to depict an activity. Activity-on-Arrow (AOA) uses an arrow to depict an activity. Basic Rules to Follow in Developing Project Networks Networks flow typically from left to right. An activity cannot begin until all preceding connected activities have been completed. Arrows on networks indicate precedent and flow and can cross over each other. Each activity should have a unique identification number. An activity identification number must be greater than that of any activities that precede it. Looping is not allowed. Conditional statements are not allowed. Where there are multiple starts, a common start node can be used to indicate a clear project beginning on the network. Similarly, a single project end node can be used to indicate a clear ending. Activity-on-Node (AON) Fundamentals Which activities must be completed immediately before this activity? These activities are called predecessor activities. Which activities must immediately follow this activity? These activities are called successor activities. Which activities can occur while this activity is taking place? This is known as a concurrent or parallel relationship. Network Computation ProcessForward Pass—Earliest Times How soon can the activity start? (early start—ES) How soon can the activity finish? (early finish—EF) How soon can the project finish? (expected time—TE) Backward Pass—Latest Times How late can the activity start? (late start—LS) How late can the activity finish? (late finish—LF) Which activities represent the critical path? (critical path—CP) How long can the activity be delayed? (slack or float—SL) Forward Pass Computation Add activity times along each path in the network (ES + Duration = EF). Carry the early finish (EF) to the next activity where it becomes its early start (ES) unless… The next succeeding activity is a merge activity, in which case the largest early finish (EF) number of all its immediate predecessor activities is selected. Backward Pass Computation Subtract activity times along each path starting with the project end activity (LF – Duration = LS). Carry the late start (LS) to the next preceding activity where it becomes its late finish (LF) unless… The next succeeding activity is a burst activity, in which case the smallest late start (LS) number of all its immediate successor activities is selected. Determining Slack (or Float) Total Slack Tells us the amount of time an activity can be delayed and not delayed the project. Is how long an activity can exceed its early finish date without affecting the project end date or an imposed completion date. Is simply the difference between the LS and ES (LS – ES = SL) or between LF and EF (LF – EF = SL) Free Slack (Float) Is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying any immediately following (successor) activity. Is how long an activity can exceed its early finish date without affecting the early start dates of any successor(s). Allows flexibility in scheduling scarce resources. Occurs only activity at the end of a chain of activities, where you have a merge activity The Critical Path Is the network path(s) that has (have) the least slack in common. Is the longest path through the activity network. Is the shortest expected time in which the entire project can be completed. Is important because it impacts completion time. Is where you put best people on. Is where you pay extra attention when doing risk assessment. Is where you don’t look when other managers are asking to ‘borrow’ people or equipment. Is where you look when you don’t have time to monitor all activities Sensitivity Network sensitivity is the likelihood the original critical path(s) will change once the project is initiated. A network schedule that has only one critical path and noncritical activities that enjoy significant slack would be labeled ‘insensitive’. Practical Considerations Network Logic Errors: no Looping, no conditional statements. Activity Numbering: biger and biger, no repeat Use of Computers to Develop Networks (and Gantt Chart) Calendar Dates Multiple Starts and Multiple Projects: using a common start and end node helps to identify the total planning period of all projects Extended Network Techniques to Come Closer to RealityLadderingActivities are broken into segments so the following activity can begin sooner and not delay the work. Use of Lags to Reduce Schedule Detail and Project DurationFinish-to-Start Relationship Start-to-Start Relationship Hammock Activity Spans over a segment of a project. Has a duration that is determined after the network plan is drawn. Is very useful in assigning and controlling indirect project costs. Is used to aggregate sections of the project to facilitate getting the right level of detail for specific sections of a project.","link":"/blog/2024/10/24/About-Project-Management-Part-2/"},{"title":"About Project Management ( Part 3 )","text":"Managing RiskRisk Management ProcessRisk Defined: An uncertain event or condition that if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect onproject objectives. No amount of planning can overcome or control risk. Risk Management Defined: An attempt to recognize and manage potential and unforeseen trouble spots that mayoccur when the project is implemented. What can go wrong (risk event) How to minimize the risk event’s impact (consequences) What can be done before an event occurs (anticipation) What to do when an event occurs (contingency plans) Benefits of Risk Management A proactive rather than reactive approach Reduces surprises and negative consequences Prepares the project manager to take appropriate action Provides better control over the future Improves chances of reaching project objectives on time, within budget, and of meeting required performance. Risk Identification Generate a list of all the possible risks that could affect the project through brainstorming and other problem identifying techniques. Focus on the events that could produce consequences, not on project objectives. Use risk breakdown structure (RBS) in conjunction with work breakdown structure (WBS) to identify and analyze risks. Identify the macro risks first then specific areas can be checked. Use risk profile (a list of questions) to address traditional areas of uncertainty on a project. Risk Assessment Scenario analysis assesses the significance of each risk event in terms of probability and impact. Risk assessment form evaluates the severity, probability of risk events and its detection difficulty. Risk severity matrix prioritizes which risks to address. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) extends the risk severity matrix by including ease of detection in the equation: Risk Value = Impact x Probability x Detection Probability analysis uses statistical techniques in assessing project risk. Decision trees, net present value (NPV), program evaluation and review technique (PERT), PERT simulation Risk Response Development Mitigating Risk Reducing the likelihood that the event will occur Reducing the impact that the adverse event would have on the project Avoiding Risk Changing the project plan to eliminate the risk or condition Transferring Risk Passing risk to another party Examples: Fixed-price contracts, insurance, Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) provisions Escalating Risk Notifying the appropriate people within the organization of the threat Retaining Risk Making a conscious decision to accept the risk of an event occurring Contingency Planning Contingency Plan Defined Is an alternative plan that will be used if a possible foreseen risk event becomes a reality. Is a plan of action that will reduce or mitigate the negative impact of the risk event. Is** not a part of the initial implementation plan** and only goes into effect after the risk is recognized. Risks of the absence of a contingency plan Cause a manager to delay or postpone the decision to implement a remedy Lead to panic and acceptance of the first remedy suggested Make the decision making under pressure which can be dangerous and costly Risk and Contingency Planning Technical Risks Backup strategies if chosen technology fails Assess whether technical uncertainties can be resolved Schedule Risks Expedite or “crash” the project to get it back on track Schedule activities in parallel or use start-to-start lag relationships Use the best people for high-risk tasks Cost Risks Review price to avoid the trap of using one lump sum to cover price risks Funding Risks Evaluate the risk of reductions in funding—a cut in the project Opportunity ManagementAn opportunity is an event that can have positive impact on project objectives. Exploit Seek to eliminate the uncertainty associated with an opportunity to ensure that it definitely happens Share Allocate some or all of the ownership of an opportunity to another party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project Enhance Take action to increase the probability and/or the positive impact of an opportunity Escalate Notify the appropriate people within the organization of the opportunity Accept Be willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs, but not taking action to pursue it Contingency Funding and Time Buffers Contingency Funds Contingency reserves—cover identified risks Management reserves—cover unidentified risks Time Buffers: Are amounts of time used to cushion against potential delays in the project Add to activities with severe risks Add to merge activities that are prone to delays Add to noncritical activities to reduce the likelihood that they will create another critical path Add to activities that require scare resources Risk Response Control Risk Register: descriptions, category, probability of occurring, impact, responses, contingency plans, owners, and current status Risk Control Executing the risk response strategy Monitoring triggering events Initiating contingency plans Watching for new risks Establishing a Change Management System Monitoring, tracking, and reporting risk Fostering an open organization environment Repeating risk identification/assessment exercises Assigning and documenting responsibility for managing risk Change Control Management Sources of Change Project scope changes Implementation of contingency plans Improvement changes Change Management Systems Identify proposed changes. List expected effects of proposed change(s) on schedule and budget. Review, evaluate, and approve or disapprove changes formally. Negotiate and resolve conflicts of change, conditions, and cost. Communicate changes to the parties affected. Assign responsibility for implementing change. Adjust the master schedule and budget. Track all changes that are to be implemented Benefits of Change Control Systems Inconsequential changes are discouraged by the formal process. Costs of changes are maintained in a log. Integrity of the WBS and performance measures is maintained. Allocation and use of contingency and management reserves are tracked. Responsibility for implementation is clarified. Effect of changes is visible to all parties involved. Implementation of change is monitored. Scope changes will be quickly reflected in baseline and performance measures Scheduling Resources and CostsOverview of the Resource Scheduling ProblemResources and Priorities Project network times are not a schedule until resources have been assigned. There are always more project proposals than there are available resources. The project priority team will add a new project only if resources are available. Cost estimates are not a budget until they have been time-phased. Once resource assignments have been finalized, you are able to develop a baseline budget schedule for the project. The Resource Scheduling Problem Resource Smoothing: delaying non-critical activities (using slack). increase resource utilization. Resource-Constrained Scheduling: some activities must be delayed Types of Resource ConstraintsTechnical or Logical Constraints: Are related to the networked sequence in which project activities must occur. Resource Constraints: Occur when the absence, shortage, or unique interrelationship and interaction characteristics of resources require a particular sequencing of project activities. Note that the resource dependency takes priority over the technological dependency but does not violate the technological dependency Types of Resources Constraints: People Materials Equipment Classification of a Scheduling Problem Time-Constrained Project: resources can be added Resource-Constrained Project: If the resources are inadequate, it will be acceptable to delay the project. Resource Allocation Methods Limiting Assumptions Splitting activities will not be allowed. Level of resources used for an activity cannot be changed. Risk Assumptions Activities with the most slack pose the least risk. Reduction of flexibility does not increase risk. The nature of an activity (easy, complex) doesn’t increase risk. Time-Constrained Projects Must be completed by an imposed date. Focus on resource utilization. Require use of resource smoothing techniques that balance demand for a resource Smoothing Resource Techniques: Delay noncritical activities by using positive slack to reduce peak demand and fill in the valleys for the resources without delaying the entire project Goals Reduce the peak of demand for the resource Reduce the number of resources over the life of the project Minimize the fluctuation in resource demand Downside Loss of flexibility that occurs from reducing slack Creates more critical activities and/or near-critical activities because of slack reduction Resource-Constrained Projectspriority rules: Minimum slack: will not inflence others Smallest (least) duration: release resource early Lowest activity identification number: logically parallel method: when the resources needed exceed the resources available, retains activities first by the priority rules. The Impacts of Resource-Constrained Scheduling: Reduces slack; reduce flexibility Increases the number of critical and near-critical activities Increases scheduling complexity because resource constraints are added to technical constraints May make the traditional critical path no longer meaningful Can break the sequence and leave the network with a set of disjointed critical activities May cause parallel activities to become sequential Can change activities from critical to noncritical Computer Demonstration of ResourceConstrained SchedulingMS project Splitting ActivitiesSplitting Tasks Is a scheduling technique used to get a better project schedule and/or to increase resource utilization. Involves interrupting the work and sending the resource to another activity for a period of time and then having the resource resume work on the original activity. Can be useful if the work involved does not include large start-up or shut-down costs. Is considered a major reason why projects fail to meet schedule. Benefits of Scheduling Resources Leaves time for considering reasonable alternatives Cost-time tradeoffs Changes in priorities Provides the information needed to prepare time-phased work package budgets with dates To gauge the impact of unforeseen events To assess how much flexibility over certain resources Assigning Project Work Reasons why we should not always assign the best people the most difficult tasks Best people: resent to the fact that they are always given the toughest assignments Less experienced participants: resent to the fact that they are never given the opportunity to expand their skill/knowledge base Factors to be considered in deciding who should work together Minimize unnecessary tension; complement each other Experience: veterans team up with new hires Future needs: have people work together early on so that they can become familiar with each other Multiproject Resource SchedulesProblems: Delays in one project create delays for other projects Inefficient resource utilization: Different schedules and requirements by multiple projects create the peaks and valleys in overall resource demands Resource bottlenecks: Shortages of critical resources required by multiple projects cause delays and schedule extensions. Approach: Create project offices or departments to oversee the scheduling of resources across multiple projects Use a project priority queuing system—first come, first served for resources Treat individual projects as part of one big project and adapt the scheduling heuristics to this “mega project” Utilize project management software to prioritize resource allocation Outsource projects to reduce the number of projects managing internally Hire temporary workers to expedite certain activities that are falling behind schedule Contract project work during peak periods when there are insufficient internal resources to meet the demands of all project Using the Resource Schedule to Develop a Project Cost Baseline Why a Time-Phased Budget Baseline Is Needed To determine if the project is on, ahead, or behind schedule and over or under its budgeted costs To assess how much work has been accomplished for the allocated money spent—the project cost baseline (planned value, PV) Creating a Time-Phased Budget Assign each work package to one responsible person or department and deliverable Compare planned schedule and costs using an integrative system called earned value Generate cash flow statements and resource usage schedules Reducing Project DurationBeing an Effective Project ManageManaging Project Teams","link":"/blog/2024/11/14/About-Project-Management-Part-3/"},{"title":"Chrome Extension","text":"Chrome Extension manifest.json build parcel request https aws load balance","link":"/blog/2024/10/20/Chrome-Extension/"},{"title":"Hello LLMs","text":"tech stack language: js python js should use inference API instead of transforms.js platform: huggingface ollama model: llama deployfrontend auto to aws aws IAM Creat user and grant the 3S full access creat a access key github repository secrets for actions backend to ec2 EC2 Amazon Linux use yum to install git &amp; python pip install -r requirements.txt huggingface-cli login security group &gt; Inbound rules pm2 sudo vs non-sudo DB mongoDB dotenv keep link safe access ip whitelist stream","link":"/blog/2024/10/17/hello-llm/"},{"title":"Post Your Blog Automaticly","text":"How to use Hexo post your blog automaticly?
