<li>Customer satisfaction is a function of the extent to which perceived performance (or outcome) <strong>exceeds expectations</strong>.</li>
<li>The met-expectation model of customer satisfaction highlights the point that whether a client is dissatisfied or delighted with a project is not based on hard facts and objective data but on <strong>perceptions and expectations</strong>.</li>

<li>The primary disadvantages of a fixed-price contract for contractors is that they run the risk of underestimating.</li>

<ul>
<li>To measure and report progress</li>
<li>To estimate cash flow</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules in Assigning Costs to the Baseline</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs are placed (time-phased) in the baseline exactly as managers expected them to be “earned.”</li>
<li>Percent complete is the workhorse most commonly used. Someone familiar with each task estimates what percent of the task has been completed or how much of the task remains.</li>
</ul>
<p>What Costs Are Included in Baselines?</p>
<ul>
<li>Baseline is the sum of the cost accounts and each cost account is the sum of the work packages in the cost account.</li>
<li>Three direct costs are typically included in baselines—labor, equipment, and materials</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Forecasted total cost at completion (EACf)<ul>

<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.</li>
<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
<li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
<li>Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.</li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development.</li>
<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
<li>Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then turns and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>

<p>The Impacts of Resource-Constrained Scheduling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces slack; reduce flexibility</li>
<li>Increases the number of critical and near-critical activities</li>
<li>Increases scheduling complexity because resource constraints are added to technical constraints</li>
<li>May make the traditional critical path no longer meaningful</li>
<li>Can break the sequence and leave the network with a set of disjointed critical activities</li>
<li>May cause parallel activities to become sequential</li>
<li>Can change activities from critical to noncritical</li>

<li>Resource bottlenecks: <strong>Shortages of critical resources</strong> required by multiple projects cause delays and schedule extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create <strong>project offices or departments</strong> to oversee the scheduling of resources across multiple projects</li>
<li>Use a project <strong>priority queuing</strong> system—first come, first served for resources</li>
<li>Treat individual projects as part of one big project and adapt the scheduling heuristics to this “<strong>mega project</strong>”</li>
<li>Utilize project management software to prioritize resource allocation</li>
<li><strong>Outsource projects</strong> to reduce the number of projects managing internally</li>

<li>Responsibility: estimates should be made by the person(s) most familiar with the task.</li>
<li>The use of several people to estimate: leads to <strong>consensus</strong> and <strong>eliminate extreme estimate errors</strong></li>
<li>Normal conditions:  based on certain <strong>assumptions</strong>. Estimates should be based on <em>normal conditions, efficient methods, and a normal level of resources</em></li>
<li>Time units: All task time estimates need consistent time units. Eg: <em>calendar days, workdays, workweeks, person days, single shift, hours, minutes</em>, etc.</li>
<li>Independence: treat each task as independent of other tasks. To avoid some rough “guesstimate” of the total time for the whole path </li>
<li>Contingencies: Work package estimates <strong>should not include</strong> allowances for contingencies.</li>
<li>Risk assessment: to avoid surprises to stakeholders. Simply identifying the degree of risk</li>

<li>Normal conditions do not apply: availability of resources. Resource shortages, whether in the form of people, equipment, or materials.</li>
<li>Things go wrong on projects: extreme weather conditions occur, accidents happen</li>
<li>Project scope and plans change.</li>
<li>People are overly optimistic.</li>

<ol>
<li>Select a reference class of projects similar to your potential project.</li>
<li>Collect and arrange outcome data as a distribution. Create a distribution of cost overruns as a percentage of the original project estimate (low to high).</li>
<li>Use the distribution data to arrive at a realistic forecast. Compare the original cost estimate for the project with the reference class projects</li>
</ol>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outside empirical data mitigates human bias.</li>
<li>Politics, strategic, and promoter forces have difficulty ignoring outside RCF information.</li>
<li>RCF serves as a reality check for funding large projects.</li>
